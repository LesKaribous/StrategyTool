# Strategy ToolBox

This repository contains the tools and resources used to generate strategies for our robots in robotics competitions. It is organized around a Jekyll site that serves as a central hub. It includes:

- Strategy generation and simulation tools
- The official rules and regulations for the National Robotics Cups
- Summary documents of strategies and robot designs for each year
- All the resources that help us define and implement the best possible strategies for our robots in the competitions

The goal is to have a central repo that brings together all the key elements to develop optimal robot strategies every year for the robotics competitions.
